# Grandfather's Website
This is a website created to celebrate the life and memories of my beloved grandfather. The website includes sections about the grandfather, his photos, playlist, a like feature, QR code, Q&A, and a contact form.
This website is also a reminder to my grandfather of all the beautiful things he went through, goes through and loves. On 31/05 he will turn 80, you can pay attention to the logo that indicates this :)
I want to say thank you to the lecturer and course practitioners for the amazing idea of this task. When I showed the site to my grandfather, he had a huge smile on his face, he was so happy and proud of me. My grandmother laughed and was moved by the story of their acquaintance that is told on the about section.
